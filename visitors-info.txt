Airbnb User Pathways Challenge

At Airbnb, guests search for homes around the world to stay in on their travels. We use data from the site to find ways in which we can help guests find listings, and better design the site user experience.

The work of the Data Science team at Airbnb is challenging. We are a two sided marketplace, with heavy seasonality and variation by cities across the globe. Discerning signal from noise and extracting the right stories from the vast amount of data we get is complicated by many of these factors.

We’re always looking for ways to improve our methods for addressing this challenge, so we want to share some of the work we do with the broader data science community. This pathways visualization problem is an opportunity for you to explore real behavioral data and help us understand its trends more clearly.

The data

Here are some basics on the dataset:

Number of records in data: 7756
Date span of the data: ['2014-05-05', '2015-04-23']
Number of unique users in data: 630
Number of unique sessions in data: 7756
Percent of sessions with search: 15.9%
Percent of sessions with sent message: 16.5%
Percent of sessions with booking request: 1.9%
The data is a sample representing user sessions in the past year in a US city. User sessions -- the time that users spend on our product -- can be long! Indeed, choosing the ideal next place you want to stay at can take time.
